# ST10023767_PROG7312 (Municipal Services Application for South Africa)

This project is part of a POE where I developed a **WPF Application** using **C#** and the **.NET Framework**. The application is designed for managing municipal services in South Africa, offering features that allow users to report issues, request services, view local events and announcements, and track service request statuses. The goal is to create an efficient and user-friendly platform that enhances the interaction between citizens and municipal services.

## Project Overview
### Part 1:
In the first part, the **"Report Issues"** functionality was implemented. This allows users to submit detailed reports about municipal issues such as sanitation, roads, utilities, etc. For more details on Part 1, see the `README_Part_1.md`.

### Part 2:
This part extends the application by introducing the **Local Events and Announcements** feature and enhancing data structures for efficient performance. Additionally, I implemented an advanced **Recommendation Feature** based on user searches, and I made use of data structures such as **Stacks**, **Priority Queues**, **Dictionaries**, **Sorted Dictionaries**, and **Sets**.

### Part 3:
This part extends the application by introducing the **Service Request Status** feature and enhancing data structures for efficient performance. Additionally, I implemented a **Status Tracking Feature** and **Filtering Feature**.I made use of data structures such as **Basic Trees**, **Binary Trees**, **Binary Search Trees**, **AVL Trees**, **Red-Black Trees**, **Heaps**, **Graphs and Graph Traversal** and a **Minimum Spanning Tree**.
